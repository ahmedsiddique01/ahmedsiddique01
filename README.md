ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Ahmed Siddique, a passionate Android engineer with 8 years of experience in crafting high-quality mobile applications. I specialize in Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Clean Architecture, and I'm an advocate for Test-Driven Development (TDD). 

My journey in Android development has been exhilarating, working on diverse projects that push the boundaries of what's possible on mobile platforms. I'm deeply committed to delivering seamless, efficient, and engaging user experiences. My skills include integrating RESTful APIs, Jetpack, GraphQL, Google Pay, Stripe SDKs, and using modern frameworks like Hilt for dependency injection.

Beyond Android, I have a profound love for Flutter. The versatility and efficiency of Flutter have captivated me, and I enjoy exploring its potential to create cross-platform applications with beautiful UIs and smooth performance.

Let's connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
