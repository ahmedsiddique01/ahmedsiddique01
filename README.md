A passionate Mobile App Developer with 8+ years of experience building high-quality Android apps, and a growing stack in cross-platform development.

Over the years, I've expanded my skillset with certifications in React Native, Flutter, NestJS, and iOS Development, allowing me to build scalable and high-performance mobile apps across platforms. From native Android using Kotlin and Jetpack to cross-platform solutions, I bring clean architecture, performance optimization, and user-centric design into every project.
